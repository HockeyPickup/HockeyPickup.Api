## üåà Overview

HockeyPickup.Api is the core backend for [HockeyPickup](https://hockeypickup.com).

The main technology stack platform is [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) 9.0.

## üõ† Prerequisites

* Install Visual Studio 2022 (preview) or later, or Visual Studio Code. Ensure that `$ dotnet --version` is at least 9.0.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Install, Build, and Serve the Site

Create a new file at the root of the HockeyPickup.Api project named `appsettings.json` with the following contents:

1. Get the `<DatabaseConnectionString>` from a local instance of SQL Server.

2. Get the `<ServiceBusConnectionString>` from Azure portal. Currently Service Bus is not available to run locally.

3. `<InviteCode>` can be any string, required to register a new account.

4. Create a `<JWTBase64Key>`: `$ openssl rand -base64 32`

### Install the packages

```bash
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet tool restore
```
Open HockeyPickup.Api.sln solution in Visual Studio, and build the solution.

You'll see output in the console showing the various local URL access points.

Swagger root [`https://localhost:7042/index.html`](https://localhost:7042/swagger/index.html)

GraphQL root [`https://localhost:7042/api/graphql`](https://localhost:7042/api/graphql)

## üß™ Unit Testing

Unit testing and code coverage are setup and **must** be maintained. To run the tests and generate a coverage report, run the Powershell script from the command line.

```bash
$ powershell ./scripts/RunTests.ps1
```

This generates a coverage report in `HockeyPickup.Api.Tests/coverage-html`. Open `index.html` to view the report.
